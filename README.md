# Coding challenge - Phase 1

This is the solution for phase 1 of the coding challenge.

It was really nice to take a look on the dicom files of our hearts.

The structure of this solution is strainght forward:
+ In code folder you can see the IPythong notebook with all comments and code for coding challenge;
+ The data, which was used to build the notebook, should be in the input folder, but I haven't upload it to Github to descrease the size of the repo. However, the folders structure and link.csv are there to understand how everything works.

Thanks!
